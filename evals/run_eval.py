"""Run the gold set through an agent with the EDGAR MCP tools attached.

What it does, in order:

1. Starts ``edgar_mcp.server`` as a subprocess over stdio and asks it for its
   six tools.
2. For every question in ``gold.yaml``, runs an agent loop: model proposes tool
   calls, this harness executes them against the MCP server, feeds results
   back, repeats until the model answers or hits the turn limit.
3. Scores the answer for accuracy, refusal correctness, citation, tool-call
   count, latency and cost.
4. Repeats the whole set ``--runs`` times, because a single run of a
   non-deterministic system is an anecdote.
5. Writes ``results/run-<timestamp>.json`` and regenerates ``results/RESULTS.md``
   with the real numbers. Nobody hand-types a figure into the README.

Providers. ``--provider anthropic`` uses the Anthropic SDK. ``--provider
openai`` talks to any OpenAI-compatible ``/chat/completions`` endpoint, which
covers Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, Together and a local vLLM. The OpenAI path
uses httpx directly rather than the ``openai`` package, so the dependency list
stays as short as the pinned one in pyproject.toml.

Free tiers. Groq and Mistral free keys have low per-minute request limits and
answer a 429 with a Retry-After header. ``--rpm`` throttles outgoing model
requests and defaults to a deliberately timid 20 for the OpenAI path.

Honesty rules this script follows:

* A question whose ``expected_value`` is still marked ``# VERIFY THIS`` is
  scored, but the results file says how many of them there were, so nobody
  reads the accuracy number as verified.
* Cost is computed from a hand-maintained price table. A model that is not in
  the table reports a null cost rather than a guess.
* Nothing is written to ``RESULTS.md`` except numbers this run measured.
